Selector
This is the HTML element name at the start of the ruleset. It defines the element(s) to be styled (in this example, <p> elements). To style a different element, change the selector.

Declaration
This is a single rule like color: red;. It specifies which of the element's properties you want to style.

Properties
These are ways in which you can style an HTML element. (In this example, color is a property of the <p> elements.) In CSS, you choose which properties you want to affect in the rule.

Property value
To the right of the property—after the colon—there is the property value. This chooses one out of many possible appearances for a given property. (For example, there are many color values in addition to red.)

Different types of selectors
There are many different types of selectors. The examples above use element selectors, which select all elements of a given type. But we can make more specific selections as well. Here are some of the more common types of selectors:

Selector name	What does it select	Example
Element selector (sometimes called a tag or type selector)	All HTML elements of the specified type.	p
selects <p>
ID selector	The element on the page with the specified ID. On a given HTML page, each id value should be unique.	#my-id
selects <p id="my-id"> or <a id="my-id">
Class selector	The element(s) on the page with the specified class. Multiple instances of the same class can appear on a page.	.my-class
selects <p class="my-class"> and <a class="my-class">
Attribute selector	The element(s) on the page with the specified attribute.	img[src]
selects <img src="myimage.png"> but not <img>
Pseudo-class selector	The specified element(s), but only when in the specified state. (For example, when a cursor hovers over a link.)	a:hover
selects <a>, but only when the mouse pointer is hovering over the link.
